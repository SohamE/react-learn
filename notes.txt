1.  We can use Fragments in 2 ways - <Fragment></Fragment> ( unnamed import from react library ), <></>

2.  Single component is an issue, we should break it into multiple components
    If the single component is having a state, so when the state changes all the components inside will rerender
    which can impact the performance.

3.  Any function starting with use is react is hook.
    useState must be called at top level, cannot be used inside normal function
    2 rule of Hooks -
        1. Only call hooks inside component functions.
        2. Only call hooks at top level, not in condition block or function block.

4. Props Concepts -
    1. Forwarded Props - using rest operator in Component argument
    2. Multiple Component Slots - JSX components can be passed as props, it should have 1 root element
    3. Element identifiers as Props
    4. Default prop values
